# Introduction
This repo containes educational examples on Franka Emika 7 DOF robot using python and robtotics toolbox and numpy. 
We hope that it will be helpful for students and engineers to get a better understanding for topic like calibration and control.

From a manifacturing stand point it extremely challenging to produce robots with zero erros in joints lenghts. Therefore each produced manipulator has small errors from the factory. Keep in mind all these small errors will affect the accuracy if not considered. It has been reported by a number of authors, the manipulator geometric errors are responsible for about 90% of the total positioning errors.
